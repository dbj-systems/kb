- There are a lot of "cathers in the rye" in the "digital woods". You want to avoid them in a wide circle.
  - Basically people who are very weak in understanding the technology but are very good with words :) 
  - This is **not** what are we doing: 
     - (for example) "HOLO" (marketing blurb) "Post-blockchain technology, value-stable cryptocurrency, and peer-to-peer hosting of scalable, distributed apps. Now is the time for popular access to an equitable, decentralized web! https://holo.host"
     - And hopefully we **do not deal** with this kind of "digital nomads" 
     - (for example) "Jean M Russell
Holo hApps Product Owner. Co-Director Commons Engine. Cultivating Flows http://www.triarchypress.net/cultivating-flows.html Thrivability http://t.co/Q6rNM51ZU4"
    - just looking into domain and document names one can not help but giggle. 
	   - (for example) "Thrivability" (laugh)

- Should we use this: https://auth0.com/
  - In general how much we can use open source?
- DBJ.Systems can/should be advertised as **anti**-trulioo platform
  - [trulioo.com](https://www.trulioo.com/)

- How imminent is this?
  - FIDO2 Project https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO2_Project
  - Web Authentication https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/
  - Windows 10 will have "no passwords" option "very soon"
     - [Windows 10 says Hello to no passwords with FIDO2 certification](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-says-hello-to-no-passwords-with-fido2-certification/)
	     - *Microsoft has passed another milestone on its quest to kill off passwords. The company has now gained official FIDO2 certification for Windows Hello, the Windows 10 biometric authentication system.* 
- WebAuthn spec is one static web site here: https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/tree/gh-pages
